Iam we design a self-supervised method that combines contrastive learning and cluster regularization by utilizing K-Means. It leverages contrastive learning to isolate specific features and then utilizes unsupervised clustering to organize the space into meaningful groups. The backbone of our framework is ResNet-50, which is put to the test on the STL-10 dataset, comprising 10 categories of both immediately labeled and unlabeled images, each with a 96Ã—96 color format.
